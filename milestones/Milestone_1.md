# Milestone 1

## Dataset

Our project is mainly focusing on agriculture and food department. Currently the selected data are:

1. The Global Dataset of Historical Yield. It offers annual time series data of 0.5-degree grid-cell yield estimates of major crops worldwide for the period 1981-2016. The crops considered in this dataset are maize, rice, wheat and soybean. The unit of yield data is t/ha. The grd-cell yield data were estimated using the satellite-derived crop-specific vegetation index and FAO-reported country yield statistics. [ðŸ”—](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909132)

2. Food Loss and Food Waste Database.  It is the largest online collection of data on both food loss and food waste and causes reported throughout the literature from FAO. The database contains data and information from openly accessible reports and studies measuring food loss and waste across food products, stages of the value chain, and geographical areas.

3. UNICEF, WHO & World Bankâ€™s Joint global database on child malnutrition. It provides country-level trends of 4 core child malnutrition indicators. All publicly available MICS and DHS with anthropometric data for the full age range of 0 to 59 months have been reanalyzed to produce standardized estimates over time.

4. Future.... Request some usage data from `Too Good To Go` to show what is currently being done in Europe to eliminate food waste.


## Problematic

1. With Ukraine Crisis, the term food crisis is appearing more and more frequently, and plus with climate change and uneven global development, food problem is becoming more and more pronounced, especially in the third world countries where many people die of hunger and suffer from nutritional deprivation every year. The food crisis is not only a social issue, but also a sustainable one for human future. On the one hand, many people die of hunger every year, and on the other hand, food waste is a growing problem. luckly we are happy to see that some organizations and companies are fighting against food waste, such as `Too Good To Go`, a Danish company fighting for food waste in food sales chain. 

2. We want to synthesize multidimensional data (food production, global hunger data, food waste data, etc). So we have two stage works, first is to make an integrated presentation, and the second is to make a correlation analysis from various different data. We try to tell the story behind the data and to call out the urgency of solving the food problem.
